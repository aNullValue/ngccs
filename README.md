# Next-gen Conference Communication Solution

HackerTracker (HT) is an app used for one-way conference communications (con staff to attendees) for numerous infosec conferences. DEF CON is the largest HT user, and HT was organically developed and modified over time to meet DEF CON's most basic scheduling needs. 

Due to expansion of DEF CON (to China), and then the COVID-19 pandemic, conference communication has grown substantially more complex than it was in the recent past. HT is still being used, and is incredibly useful to many attendees, but its limited data structure & abilities will cause increased administrative burden and decreased quality of user experience over time. In order to determine what functionality is necessary for a modern conference communication solution, we should solicit feedback from its most-valuable users: a varied sampling of end-users, infobooth staff, conference organizers, HackerTracker service administrators, etc.

This repo is intended to be a brainstorming and early high-level planning resource for the next-gen conference communication solution. Let's use GitHub's "Issues" functionality to collect (and later triage) feature requests, brainstorming thoughts, and related discussion.

Are you an existing user of HackerTracker or another conference management app, and you have an idea for improvement? Please let us know, by [opening an issue](https://github.com/aNullValue/ngccs/issues)!
